## Hi, I'm Jakub Morawa!👋
I’m a developer constantly striving to improve my coding skills. I’ve worked on projects in web development, Java, Python, and data-driven tools, and I enjoy creating projects that highlight data visualization, simulations, and mathematical problem-solving. My goal is to build practical, interactive projects that both challenge me and showcase what I can do.

## Projects I've Worked On
<ul>
  <li>📈 <b>Pendulum Sim:<br></b> A Java Swing application that simulates a pendulum and lets users adjust variables like length, gravity, and starting angle.</li><br>
  
  <li>🌍 <b>Country Data:<br></b> A searchable country-information tool that displays stats and details pulled from a structured JSON dataset.</li><br>
  
  <li>🌥️ <b>Weather Station JM:<br></b> An interactive website where users can click on a map to get weather analytics and location-based data.</li><br>
  
  <li>🐶🐱 <b>Dog and Cat Pics:<br></b> A fun project that uses APIs to fetch random dog and cat images along with additional info.</li><br>
</ul>
