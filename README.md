## Hi, I'm Jakub Morawa!👋
I am a developer who is striving to improve their coding skills. I have worked on projects that include web development, JavaScript, Python, and data-driven tools. I want to create projects that show off data, simulations, and coding structures.

## Projects I've Worked On
<ul>
  <li>📈 <b>Pendulum Sim:<br></b> A Java Swing application that simulates a pendulum and lets users adjust variables like length, gravity, and starting angle.</li><br>
  
  <li>🌍 <b>Country Data:<br></b> A searchable country-information tool that displays stats and details pulled from a structured JSON dataset.</li><br>
  
  <li>🌥️ <b>Weather Station JM:<br></b> An interactive website where users can click on a map to get weather analytics and location-based data.</li><br>
  
  <li>🐶🐱 <b>Dog and Cat Pics:<br></b> A fun project that uses APIs to fetch random dog and cat images along with additional info.</li><br>
</ul>
