## Hi, I'm Jakub Morawa!👋
I’m a developer constantly striving to improve my coding skills. I’ve worked on projects in web development, Java, Python, and data-driven tools, and I enjoy creating projects that highlight data visualization, simulations, and mathematical problem-solving. My goal is to build practical, interactive projects that both challenge me and showcase what I can do.

## Projects I've Worked On

- 📈 **[Pendulum Sim](https://github.com/JakubMorawa/Java-Pendulum-Simulation)** A Java Swing application that simulates a pendulum and lets users adjust variables like length, gravity, and angle.  

- 🌍 **[Country Data](https://github.com/JakubMorawa/Country-Data)** A searchable country-information tool that displays stats and details pulled from a structured JSON dataset.  

- 🌥️ **[Weather Station JM](https://github.com/JakubMorawa/WeatherStationJM)** An interactive website where users can click on a map to get weather analytics and location-based data.  

- 🐶🐱 **[Dog and Cat Pics](https://github.com/JakubMorawa/Dog-and-Cat-Pics)** A fun project that uses APIs to fetch random dog and cat images along with additional info.
